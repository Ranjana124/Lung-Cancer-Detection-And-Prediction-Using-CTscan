## 📁 Dataset

- **Dataset Used**: [IQ-OTH/NCCD – Iraq-Oncology Teaching Hospital/National Center for Cancer Diseases]([https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/lung-cancer-dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hamdallak/the-iqothnccd-lung-cancer-dataset))  
- The dataset contains CT scan images categorized into:
  - **Normal**
  - **Benign**
  - **Malignant**

- **Preprocessing Steps**:
  - Image resizing (e.g., 224x224)
  - Normalization (0-1 scaling)
  - Data augmentation (rotation, zoom, horizontal flip)

- Data split into training, validation, and test sets using an 80/10/10 ratio.
